# Internet Noise

#### Internet Noise is a javascript program that floods an ISP's database with nonsense by visiting random websites and performing random Google searches.

This project was inspired by Dan Schiltz's [Internet Noise generator](https://slifty.github.io/internet_noise/). I recreated the site from scratch using easier-to-understand javascript as an educational exercise. As he mentions on his version, running this _"will make some noise as a form of digital protest. IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU SAFE."_
